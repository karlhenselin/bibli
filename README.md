## History

In 2021, Josh "powerlanguage" Wardle created _Wordle_, a version of the Lingo word game that you can play once a day. The target word is the same for everyone each day, and you can share results to Twitter and compare with your friends. This made Wordle [go absolutely viral](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/03/technology/wordle-word-game-creator.html) around January 2022.

I liked this game a lot, but wanted to play a game that would also put me in God's Word. 

## For developers

To run the code locally, first install [Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm#using-a-node-version-manager-to-install-nodejs-and-npm). Then, in this directory, open a terminal and run `npm install` followed by `npm run start`. _hello wordl_ will be running at http://localhost:3000/. Any changes you make to the source code will be reflected there. Have fun!

Finally, `npm run deploy` will deploy your code to the `gh-pages` branch of your fork, so that everyone can play your version at https://yourname.github.io/bubli (or the name of your fork if you renamed it).
